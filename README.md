# Engineering Thesis – 2016
The attached files include:
- Python software for the Raspberry Pi platform, handling communication with the client application, motor control, and data acquisition from sensors.
- C# software for PC, allowing the user to control the platform’s movement and read data from sensors.
- A database for storing measurements collected from the platform’s sensors.

  Note: This project was created as part of my engineering thesis in 2016. The code may be outdated and is provided for archival and demonstrative purposes only.
